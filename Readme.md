# Angular 2: Authentication sample.

This sample shows how to create an angular 2 app that:
* Has **lots of different routes**
* Performs **authentication with JWTs**
* **Calls APIs** authenticated and not.
* Extends the **RouterOutlet** for route pipeline changes.

You can **learn more about how it works in the following blogposts**
